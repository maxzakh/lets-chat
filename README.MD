This is a React-Native project so you will need to install Expo to run it, I also recommend getting the Expo app from the app store so that you can run it on your phone.

Install:
```npm i```
```npm install expo-cli -g```
Run: 
```expo start```

This will bring up a QR code for your phone if you have the Expo app installed
